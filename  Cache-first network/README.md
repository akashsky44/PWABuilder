#Cache-first network

Use this service worker to pre-cache content. The content you add to the "cache-array" will be added immediately to the cache and service from the cache whenever a page requests it. At the same time it will update the cache with the version you have on the server. Configure your file array to include all your site files, or a subset that you want to be served quickly.
